CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o spfabia: fabia for a sparse data matrix (in sparse matrix
      format) and sparse vector/matrix computations in the code 
      to speed up computations.
      spfabia applications: 
            (a) detecting >identity by descent< in next generation 
                sequencing data with rare variants, 
            (b) detecting >shared haplotypes< in disease studies based 
                on next generation sequencing data with rare variants

    o fabia for non-negative factorization (parameter: non_negative)

    o changed to C and removed dependencies to Rcpp

    o improved update for lambda (alpha should be smaller, e.g. 0.03)

    o introduced maximal number of row elements (lL)

    o introduced cycle bL when upper bounds nL or lL are effective

    o reduced computational complexity


BUG FIXES

    o update formula for lambda: tighter approximation

    o corrected inverse of the conditional covariance matrix of z 


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o introduced maximal number of row elements (nL)

BUG FIXES

    o single or no bicluster

    o zero elements in biclusters
